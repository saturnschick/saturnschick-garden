# 🌱 About Me

This is **Sheng** 🍓  

But for the purpose of this garden, I'm called **saturnschick** 🪐  

I'm a Filipina from **Davao City, Philippines**, and I recently migrated to **Poland**. I'm happily married to a wonderful Polish man, living and loving life by his side, while also embracing my European dream.  

Most of my time here in Poland is spent enjoying my quiet, dream life—learning both childhood and new recipes, photographing the views of my neighborhood, endlessly scrolling through social media, and pursuing my various interests such as **astrology, esoterics, history, and medicine**.  

I decided to plant this **digital garden** as a productive outlet for my thoughts and curiosities.  

So, come on in—**welcome to my garden** 🌸
